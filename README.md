Network Intrusion Detection System



A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a security tool that watches network traffic for malicious activity or policy violations, analyzing data packets for known attack patterns (signatures) or unusual behavior (anomalies) and alerting administrators to threats like DoS attacks, port scans, or malware, crucial for overall network defense by spotting threats that bypass traditional firewalls. NIDS sits at strategic points, examining traffic across subnets without using host resources, but struggles with encrypted data; a related but different system is the Host-based IDS (HIDS) which monitors a single device.
